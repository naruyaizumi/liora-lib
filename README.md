**NOTE:** This library is **Linux-exclusive** and requires native dependencies. Running on other operating systems (Windows, macOS) or non-x64 architectures will fail.
All prebuilt binaries are compiled for **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (x64)**. Errors outside this environment are **not library bugs** unless dependencies are properly installed.

**Liora-lib** is a high-performance Node.js native addon providing multimedia and system-level utilities.
It exposes modules for media conversion, sticker encoding, EXIF metadata handling, and optimized HTTP fetching ‚Äî all implemented in C++ with an ES module interface.
